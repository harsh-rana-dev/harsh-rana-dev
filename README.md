# Hi 👋, I'm Harsh

### Junior DataOps Engineer | Reliable Python Data Pipelines | Idempotency & Data Quality

---

🔭 I’m currently building **[Dataflow Sentinel](https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel)** — a production-style data pipeline that enforces schema validation, idempotent logic, and operational visibility.

## Featured Projects

- **[Dataflow Sentinel](https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel)** — End-to-end Python DataOps pipeline with:
  - Data validation & schema enforcement

## About This Profile

I focus on **reliable, maintainable, and low-overhead data pipelines**. My systems are designed to:

- Be **idempotent**: safe to rerun without duplicates
- **Validate data** at ingestion to prevent garbage entries
- Provide **operational visibility** and logs for every run
- Run consistently across environments via Docker & Compose
- Automate scheduling and execution using GitHub Actions

I’m actively seeking **junior / contract DataOps roles (EU/Remote)** where I can contribute to production-ready pipelines, operational reliability, and robust data workflows.

## Goals & Philosophy

- Build pipelines that **do not break** and are easy for anyone to maintain
- Demonstrate real-world **DataOps principles** like retries, validation, idempotency, and observability
- Share work transparently to signal reliability and professionalism
