## 🚀 Featured Project: Dataflow Sentinel

**Dataflow Sentinel** is an automated pipeline designed to bridge the gap between “scripts that work” and **systems that last**.

- **Idempotent Ingestion:** Multi-stage SQLAlchemy upsert logic ensures zero duplicates on reruns.
- **Validation Gates:** Strict schema enforcement via **Pydantic** to reject malformed data before hitting the DB.
- **Operational Pulse:** Generates JSON run summaries (status, row counts, duration) for external monitoring.
- **Reproducible Ops:** Fully containerized via **Docker Compose** for consistent environment behavior.

## 🏛️ Engineering Philosophy

I build systems for **Monday morning at 4:00 AM**. When a pipeline fails, it shouldn’t be a mystery. My pipelines are designed to:

1. **Fail Loudly:** Logging and validation make errors immediately visible.  
2. **Restart Safely:** Idempotent logic eliminates the need for manual cleanup.  
3. **Stay Clean:** Bronze/Silver/Gold separation maintains lineage and data trust.  

The goal is reliability, maintainability, and operational transparency over flashy tech.
