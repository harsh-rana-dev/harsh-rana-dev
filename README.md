## 🚀 Featured Project: Dataflow Sentinel

**Dataflow Sentinel** is an automated pipeline designed to bridge the gap between "scripts that work" and "systems that last."

- **Idempotent Ingestion:** Multi-stage SQLAlchemy upsert logic ensuring zero duplicate records on reruns.
- **Validation Gates:** Strict schema enforcement using **Pydantic** to reject malformed data before it hits the DB.
- **Operational Pulse:** Generates JSON run summaries (status, row counts, duration) for external monitoring.
- **Reproducible Ops:** Fully containerized via **Docker Compose** for consistent environment behavior.

## 🏛️ Engineering Philosophy

I build for **Monday morning at 4:00 AM**. 
When a pipeline fails, it shouldn't be a mystery. My systems are designed to:
1. **Fail Loudly:** Clear logging and validation errors.
2. **Restart Safely:** Idempotent logic means no manual cleanup required after a crash.
3. **Stay Clean:** Bronze/Silver/Gold data separation to maintain lineage and trust.
