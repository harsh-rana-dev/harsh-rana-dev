# Hi, I’m Harsh 👋

### DataOps / Analytics Engineering — Reliable, Observable Data Pipelines

---

I build **production-style data pipelines** focused on **data quality, operational reliability, and reproducibility**.

My work prioritizes systems that **fail loudly, surface data issues early, and run consistently across local, Docker, and CI environments**.

## 🚀 Featured Project: DATAFLOW-SENTINEL

🔗 https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel

A production-inspired DataOps pipeline designed to prevent **silent failures and stale data**.

**What it demonstrates:**
- **Medallion Architecture:** Bronze → Silver → Gold data layers
- **Schema Enforcement:** Pydantic-based validation gates
- **Freshness Monitoring:** Explicit freshness signals, not implicit success
- **Operational Parity:** Identical behavior on local, Docker, and GitHub Actions
- **CI-Driven Execution:** Scheduled runs with visible success/failure notifications

Built to resemble **real DataOps and Analytics Engineering workflows**, not demo scripts.

## 🛠️ Core Stack

- Python, pandas, Pydantic
- PostgreSQL (local & Neon), SQLAlchemy
- Docker & Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions, Makefile
- pytest, Linux / Bash
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🏛️ Working Philosophy

I design pipelines for **ownership and predictability**, not experimentation.

That means:
- Validate data before trusting it
- Make failures visible and actionable
- Keep environments reproducible
- Prefer boring, reliable systems over clever ones
