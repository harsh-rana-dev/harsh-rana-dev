# Hi 👋, I'm Harsh

### Junior DataOps Engineer | Reliable Python Data Pipelines | Idempotency & Data Quality

---

🔭 I’m currently building **[Dataflow Sentinel](https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel)** — a production-style data pipeline that enforces schema validation, idempotent logic, and operational visibility.

## About This Profile

I focus on **building reliable, maintainable Python data pipelines** that prioritize **data correctness, operational safety, and rerun reliability**.  

My pipelines are designed to:

- Be **idempotent**, safe to rerun without creating duplicates
- **Validate incoming data** with schema enforcement
- Provide **operational visibility** through logs and monitoring
- Run consistently across environments using **Docker & Compose**
- Automate scheduling and execution using **GitHub Actions**

The current project, **Dataflow Sentinel**, demonstrates real-world DataOps concerns like safe retries, failure handling, and long-term maintainability.

## Goals & Philosophy

- Build **robust pipelines** that operate without manual intervention
- Demonstrate **DataOps best practices**: idempotency, validation, observability
- Focus on **reliability and repeatability** over flashy tech
- Share work transparently to signal **professional competence**
- Secure a **junior / contract DataOps role (EU/Remote)** to apply real-world pipelines in production
