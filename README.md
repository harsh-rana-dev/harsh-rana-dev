# Hi, I’m Harsh 👋

### DataOps / Automation Engineering — Reliable & Observable Data Systems

---

I design and build **production-oriented data pipelines** with a focus on:

* Data quality enforcement
* Operational reliability
* Reproducible execution environments
* Clear failure visibility

My systems are built to **fail loudly, validate early, and run deterministically across local, Docker, and CI environments**.

I prioritize correctness, observability, and ownership over quick demos.

## 🚀 Featured Project — DATAFLOW-SENTINEL

🔗 [https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel](https://github.com/harsh-rana-dev/Dataflow-Sentinel)

A production-inspired DataOps pipeline built to prevent **silent data corruption and unnoticed staleness**.

### What It Demonstrates

* **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
* **Schema Enforcement with Pydantic**
* **Freshness Monitoring with explicit signals**
* **Idempotent, deterministic pipeline execution**
* **Operational parity across Local, Docker, and GitHub Actions**
* **CI-driven scheduled runs with visible success/failure alerts**

This project mirrors real-world DataOps and Analytics Engineering workflows — emphasizing reliability and operational discipline rather than tutorial-style scripts.

## 🧊 Core Stack

**Language**

* Python

**Data & Validation**

* pandas
* Pydantic
* SQLAlchemy

**Infrastructure**

* PostgreSQL (Local & Neon)
* Docker & Docker Compose
* GitHub Actions
* Makefile

**Testing & Tooling**

* pytest
* Linux / Bash
* Git & GitHub

## 🏛️ Engineering Philosophy

I build systems for **ownership and predictability**.

* Validate data before promotion
* Surface issues immediately
* Keep execution deterministic
* Prefer simple, maintainable architectures
* Treat failures as signals, not inconveniences

Reliable systems scale. Silent ones break.
